# ⚡ ComplexLab v1.0

**ComplexLab** is a modern, high-tech desktop application designed to handle complex mathematical operations.
 It focuses specifically on **Complex Numbers**, providing a powerful symbolic engine and a sleek "Cyberpunk" dark-mode interface.



## 🎯 Overview
This tool was developed to simplify advanced algebra and geometry. Whether you are a student or an engineer,
 ComplexLab provides instant solutions with professional **LaTeX mathematical rendering**.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Quadratic Equation Solver**: Solves $az^2 + bz + c = 0$ even with complex coefficients.
* **N-th Roots Calculator**: Finds all $n$ roots of any complex number and provides step-by-step logic.
* **Locus & Geometry**: Automatically identifies geometric shapes (Lines, Circles) from complex equations and plots them.
* **Expansion & Linearization**: Uses Euler's formulas to linearize trigonometric expressions or expand binomials.
* **Complex Sequences**: Calculates the $n$-th term and the sum of geometric sequences.
* **Planar Transformations**: Handles Translations, Rotations, and Homothety in the complex plane.



## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **Python 3.14: The core programming language.
* **SymPy**: A library for symbolic mathematics (the "brain" of the app).
* **CustomTkinter**: A modern UI library for the futuristic Dark Mode.
* **Matplotlib**: Used for high-quality mathematical rendering and geometric plotting.
